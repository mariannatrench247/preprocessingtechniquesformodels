# QUESTIONS TO ASK MYSELF BEFORE PREPROCESSING ?
### What kind of data am I working with ? (images, text, audio, etc)
### What kind of outcome am I seeking with data? 
### How / where will the data work with the model ? 
### 
### Feature Selection : selecting/discarding relevant / irrelevant features 
### Feature Extraction : (m) attributes --> (n) attributes


# Extraction Examples 
  - color histograms 
  - pixel counts 
   
  - techniques dependent on data 
   
 # Content of Image 
  - content
  - texture 
  - shape 
  - position
  - dominant edges of image items / regions 
  
 # Histogram 
 - pixel counts
 - x / y axis 
 - color features of image 
 - vector of 256 image
 - queries (distance range = similarity) 
 - dimensionality curse ( too many features(dimensions))
 - cross talk (colors close to each other (Database queries cose to eachother))
